# Release notes

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-28: accounts, Authelia and core data

**Accounts**
- Sign-in is required. On first start, a one-time setup code in the
  container log creates the first admin; the admin creates everyone else
  on the **Users** page (app password or Authelia), and can disable,
  reset or delete an account.
- Three roles — admin, editor, player — each seeing and doing only what
  their row of the roles table allows; the server enforces every rule, not
  just the UI. Each person owns their own runners; admins and editors can
  view and print everyone's, read-only.
- Sign in with an app password, or with [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/)
  (OpenID Connect, with Authelia's own two-factor) per account.
- Locked out? `docker exec chummer-anarchy2 node server/users.mjs reset
  <user>` prints a one-time recovery code for `/#/setup/reset`.

**Core data out of the repository**
- The core rulebook's catalogs (levels, metatypes, skills, pricing, amp
  types and effects, packages, lifestyles, generic weapons, armor,
  vehicles) no longer ship with the app or live in its git history. A
  server builds them by importing the CRB PDF like any other book, or an
  admin loads a **data pack** — a small zip of just those tables, with no
  descriptions, PDFs or keys — exported from another server. Upgrading a
  server that already has the CRB in its Library re-imports it
  automatically on first start.

**Security hardening**
- Passwords hashed with scrypt; sessions are random tokens, stored as
  hashes, 30-day sliding expiry, `Secure`/`__Host-` behind a trusted
  proxy.
- Sign-in lockout per account and per client address/network, with a
  known-device cookie so a household's other sign-ins aren't slowed by one
  wrong password; every non-GET request is checked against its Origin.
- `TRUST_PROXY` and `PUBLIC_URL` settings (Unraid template: **Trusted
  proxy**, **Public address**) so the app knows which forwarded headers to
  believe when it sits behind a reverse proxy, with an example nginx rate
  limit for the login route.

**Backup changes**
- Backups now include accounts (`users.xml`, sign-in settings, every
  runner folder); sessions never do. The Authelia client secret travels
  only with **Include my API keys**. A restore signs everyone out; a
  backup from before accounts puts the server back into setup, with its
  runners going to the new first admin.

**Breaking**
- The app now requires signing in — it's no longer open to anyone who can
  reach it. Plan for the first-start setup code when upgrading.
- A server with no core data (a fresh install, or an upgrade whose CRB PDF
  isn't in its Library) opens on a setup page until the CRB is imported or
  a data pack is uploaded.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-28: edit the catalog, back up the server

**Catalog edits**
- An **Edit** button on any amp, item or rule (pickers, Game data, the Rules
  page) opens the Amp Builder in catalog mode, or a form with a Description
  box. Edits live in their own layer on the server, so a re-import never
  touches them; an edited entry gets an **Edited** mark and a **Restore
  book version** button.
- **Add entry** creates a new amp, item or rule under a house-rule source
  you name or pick.

**Backup and restore**
- Settings → **Backup**: **Download backup** zips up everything the server
  keeps — runners, house rules and edits, imported books, uploaded PDFs and
  AI settings — with "Include my API keys" left unticked by default.
- **Restore from backup** uploads a zip, shows what's in it (date, app
  version, file counts) before anything changes, then replaces the
  server's data. The server saves its own current state first, to
  `library/.backups` (newest 3 kept), so a restore can be undone.
  Restores are capped at 20 GB.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-28: bring your own books

The app no longer ships any book content. You upload the PDFs you own and it
builds its catalogs from them.

**Importing books**
- A **Books** page: upload a PDF, watch the import, re-import or remove it.
  Uploads, their converted text and import reports stay in the Library
  folder, which is never served over the web.
- Recipes for the core rulebook (spells, amps, gear, the 12 pregens and the
  Lightning example), the Conversion Guide (complex forms, technomancer
  rules), Daegann's Shadow Amps Expanded List, his pregen booklet (15 sample
  runners) and the quick-reference sheets (116 rules).
- Descriptions are kept privately per book, next to your imports.
- Any other book can go through an AI you set up: Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible
  (including Ollama and LM Studio), Gemini or AnythingLLM. Pick the model from
  a list loaded with your key, or type it. Proposed entries wait on a review
  screen until you accept, edit or drop them.
- API keys are stored in their own file, never shown again, and cleared if a
  provider's address changes.

**Catalog**
- Canon and non-canon: the core rulebook and Conversion Guide are canon;
  Daegann's material and the quick-reference sheets are published but not
  canon. Each runner can be set to flag non-canon content.
- Every entry shows which book and page it comes from. When two books define
  the same thing, both are kept and labelled.
- Six extra specializations from the expanded amp list, a searchable Rules
  page and hover help on amp effects.
- Existing runners keep working: their entries are mapped to the right book.

**Installing**
- Published as a public image, `ghcr.io/jbowensii/chummer-anarchy2`, with an
  Unraid template in [jbowensii/unraid-templates](https://github.com/jbowensii/unraid-templates).
  A new **Library** folder holds your uploaded books.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-27: first version

Character creation with a live nuyen receipt and cited rule checks, the
Shadow Amp builder, weapons, vehicles, technomancers, lifestyles, the career
ledger, a printable sheet in the book's style, light and dark themes, and
runners saved as XML files on the server.
